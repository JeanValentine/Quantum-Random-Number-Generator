# Quantum-Random-Number-Generator (QRNG)
---
# What is going on?

  This program generates true randomness using quantum circuits. This project is a quantum based random number generator built using Qiskit. It uses the principles of **quantum superposition** to generate random bits, which are fundamentally more unpredictable than classical pseudorandom number generators. Its important to remember that quantum randomness isnt just noise. Quantum randomness is sort of like entropy. 

# Features 
  * Generate any number of quantum random bits
  * Visualize the distribution of 0s and 1s using a histogram
  * Built on Qiskit's AerSimulator backend
  * Clear inline documentation for learning and exploration

# Installation
  You will need to use **python 3.10** and 'pip' to run this program. 

    Step 1: Clone the repository 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JeanValentine/quantum-rng.git
    cd quantum-rng


    Step 2: Install dependencies 

    pip install qiskit qiskit-aer matplotlib 


    Step 3: Run the script using 

    ```bash 
    python qrng.py
